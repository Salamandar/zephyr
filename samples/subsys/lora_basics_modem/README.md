# LoRa Basics Modem samples

Those examples provide reference code from Semtech adapted to Zephyr for LBM.

* porting_tests: Some low level tests from LBM to validate the Zephyr port
* hw_modem:Â For testing purposes, exposes an UART bus usually handled by Pytest scripts
* lctt_certif: The reference LCTT certification example
* periodical_uplink: A fully working example that joins the network + periodical uplink when the user presses the button.


## Board support

The samples are tested on the `nrf52840dk/nrf52840` board and the shields provided by this repository.
If any other board is used, a new DTS overlay should be created for it.

## Building and flashing

Go into the sample you want to flash, then run (with the relevant board and shield):

```bash
west build -b nrf52840dk/nrf52840 -- -DSHIELD=semtech_lr1110mb1xxs
west flash
```
